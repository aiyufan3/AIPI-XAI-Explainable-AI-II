# AIPI-XAI-Explainable-AI-II
This project applies Explainable AI techniques, including PDP, ICE, and ALE plots, to interpret a Random Forest model trained on the California Housing dataset. We visualize feature impacts, perform permutation feature importance analysis, and evaluate model performance using RÂ² and MSE metrics to assess interpretability.
